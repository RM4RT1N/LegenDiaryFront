# LegenDiaryFront

The application is the result of the work of a group of 3 people during the course as a credit project. 

The idea for the app , was to create a site to learn about local legends and beliefs without searching hundreds of pages.

The aim of the project was to write an application using java and springboot and to present it using react. The result is a platform with a map at its heart. It integrates the rest of the application's functionality. While reading the legend added to the map, it allows you to listen to local radio broadcasts or check the weather in a given place. A voiceover is also available, which reads the text of the legend at the user's request.

In order to achieve compatibility between the various functionalities of the website, the project uses an external free api to ensure smooth operation.

The project is in the process of being expanded with new functionalities.
